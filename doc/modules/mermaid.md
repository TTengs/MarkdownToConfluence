# Mermaid.js
Mermaid lets you create diagrams and visualizations using text and code.

It is a Javascript based diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically.

These diagrams will be rendered and uploaded to confluence as a PNG, and displayed on the page at the location of the macro.

You can read more about how to write mermaid diagrams [here](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/)
