# Jira Tickets
Jira tickets can be referenced and rendered by simply writing the unique key for the ticket/issue.

The status of the issue wil automatically be updated, when it changes on Jira

## Example
Markdown:

```markdown
BAC-74
this ticket, BAC-77, is within a line
```

This will be rendered like this:

![jira-ticket](../images/jira%20ticket.PNG)
